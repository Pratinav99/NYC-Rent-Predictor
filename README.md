## Project Overview
The objective is to create a model that predicts rent prices for typical New York City apartments. The key focus is on denoising the dataset to enhance the prediction accuracy.

## Results
The final model's performance is evaluated based on the out-of-bag score averaged over 10 runs. Detailed results and analysis can be found in the notebook.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building a predictive model for rent prices, focusing on data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation using random forest models.
